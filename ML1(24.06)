from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
#In the code above, we loaded the "iris" dataset from "sklearn.datasets" into our code.
#The iris dataset is a very common example dataset in the field of machine learing and data analysis.

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
#In the code above, we loaded the "train_test_split" from "sklearn.model_selection" into our code.(I guess you understand this event :D )
#This function allows us to split the dataset into training and test subsets. 
#You problably think this suggestion " what does mean training and test sets?".
#The training set is the dataset that the model uses in the learing process.
#Using this dataset, the model learnds relationships and optimizes itself.
